  <h2>About Homeopathy</h2>
  <p>   Homeopathy is a natural and permanent way of cure which works by acting on the root cause of the Disease removing it permanently rather than suppressing, Hence preventing its recurrence. The natural medicinal substances being non-synthetic in origin leave no side effects.

Discovered by German M.D. physician, Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, Homeopathy has existed for more than 200 years, and yet, is the youngest system of Medicine.Homeopathy is a Medical science based on the well proven premise that the body has its own power to heal. A healthy body is like a well-oiled machine where every part and organ of the body works in harmony. When the disrupting cause is stronger, then the body alone cannot manage to recover on its own and sickness surfaces in the form of sign and symptoms. Here, our body needs an external force which will aid the body to recover and this is where Homeopathy steps in. It strengthens the immune system and helps the system to fight back and recover faster.

Homeopathy looks for the cause, the root of the disease. When the cause is removed, the disease automatically goes away. All Homeopathic medicines are prepared largely from naturally occurring substances –plant kingdom, mineral kingdom and animal kingdom. Each medicine is thoroughly proved on healthy human beings to get the most accurate remedy picture.Homeopathy works by stimulating and restoring the body’s vital energy to heal and when this happens you will be rid of each of your troubles small or big, old or new. Since the immune system is energized, Homeopathy protects you from future troubles also.Homeopathy works as a preventive and helps to maintain the healthy state of the individual not affected by the environment.
